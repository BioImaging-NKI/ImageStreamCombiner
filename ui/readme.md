The .ui files were designed with \Qt\Tools\QtDesignStudio\qt6_design_studio_reduced_version\bin\designer.exe

They were converted with to .py files with the same name.
* Windows: `venv\Scripts\pyuic6.exe -o ui\form.py ui\form.ui`
* Linux: `venv/bin/pyuic6 -o ui/form.py ui/form.ui`


! Never ! edit the generated .py files, but edit the .ui files if you want to change the ui.
